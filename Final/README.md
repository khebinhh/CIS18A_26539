***IGNORE FILE: Reservations AS IT IS NOT MY FINAL PROJECT SUBMISSION***

For CIS18A, my final project will be under Restaurant!

Option 1: Business Program
  Write a Java program to place order and set appointment for delivery of goods or services from a 
  business of your choice (restaurant, grocery, mobile pet spa, mobile car detailer, home cleaning, home 
  repair/improvement, etc.

  The program should prompt the user to select products or services and appointment or 
  delivery date, and time based on business operation time.
  The program should display the user selection on screen.
  The program should output the order summary and appointment in a text file.

Restaurant: The program is designed to display two menus depending whether the user
            input the time of meal. Then the program will have choices depending on lunch or dinner
            and the user will select one or more plates to eat. The program will then
            calculate the bill from the selected choices of the menu and will end the program.
