Hello! This is my CIS-18A course for Java Programming.

Course Description 
An introduction to Java programming for students already experienced in the fundamentals of 
programming. An emphasis will be placed upon object- oriented programming. Other topics include 
graphical interface design and typical swing GUI components. 

Course Content

1. Introduction to the Java Environment 
  a. The design and development environment, 
  b. Java applications and Java Applets. 
2. Control Structures I 
  a. Algorithms, primitive data types, 
  b. If-then-Else redirection, and While loops. 
3. Control Structures II 
  a. For loops, 
  b. Switch selection, 
  c. Do/While loops, 
  d. Logical operators. 
4. Creating and Using Methods 
  a. Modules, 
  b. API packages, 
  c. Recursion and overloading. 
5. Arrays in Java 
  a. Declaration, 
  b. Allocation, 
  c. Passing parameters to methods, by value, reference 
  d. Single vs. multiple subscripted arrays. 
6. Object Based Programming 
  a. Class scope 
  b. Visibility, controlling access, creating packages, data abstraction, and 
      information hiding. 
7. Object-Oriented Programming 
  a. Defining and utilizing super classes and subclasses. 
  b. Inheritance concepts. 
8. Graphics and Java2D 
  a. Font, 
  b. Color, 
  c. Shape Control. 
9. Basic Graphical User Interface Components 
  a. Event handling, 
  b. Layout managers 
  c. Standard GUI components. 
  
  Course Student Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Demonstrate an understanding of the Java IDE programming environment sufficient 
to write small to medium sized programs. 
2.  Demonstrate an understanding of the fundamentals of object-oriented 
development sufficient to create and use classes as the foundation of Java 
application programs. 

Knowledge and skills that you should have before entering this course include: 
1. Compose, compile, and run general purpose programs 
2. Create computer programs using the principles of structured programming. 
3. Apply the principles of logical and programming concepts to develop specific solutions 
    for gaming, business, scientific and mathematics problems. 
4. Identify the information input requirements, synthesize the algorithmic steps needed to 
    transform the data input into the required output information, and organize the output 
    format to facilitate user communication. 
5. Demonstrate the use of an IDE and libraries. 
6. Demonstrate the fundamentals of computer programming, problem solving, and 
    software design.
